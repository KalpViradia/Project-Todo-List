## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Task Management Interface**:
   The app displays an input box to enter a new task. Each task consists of a title and optional metadata like completion status.

2. **Adding a Task**:
   Type your task in the input field and click "Add" to push it into the list. Angular's form handling instantly updates the view.

3. **Mark as Complete**:
   You can check off tasks to mark them as done. The completed tasks are visually styled differently for easy tracking.

4. **Edit or Delete**:
   Tasks can be edited or removed by clicking the respective icons beside each task.

5. **Tailwind Styling**:
   The entire layout is styled with Tailwind for a mobile-first, responsive experience.
